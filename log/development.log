ActionController::UnknownFormat (PublicController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Please rename this column if you didn't intend it to be used for storing the inheritance class or overwrite Complaint.inheritance_column to use another column for that information.):
